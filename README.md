STEP 2: Import the Libraries

This tells Python you want to use the tools from the libraries you just installed. Itâ€™s like turning them on.

You're also importing tools for:
- Cleaning and scaling data (like LabelEncoder, StandardScaler)
- Machine learning models (KMeans for clustering, Decision Trees, etc.)
- Splitting your data for training/testing
- Measuring accuracy and performance

Step 3a: Upload Your Dataset
- Uploads a CSV file 
- Reads it into a DataFrame with pd.read_csv()
- Strips extra spaces from column names
- Shows the first 5 rows

Step 3b: Exploring Data with Smart Tools
- Used the "Generate code with df" tool to auto-generate Python code from a natural language question.
- It filtered the dataset based on year, rating, and genre.
- You can also click "View recommended plots" to get instant charts based on the filtered data.
- The "New interactive sheet" lets you explore multiple data visually in a spreadsheet like view , perfect for quick analysis without writing extra code.

Step 3c: Explore & Filter Your Results (Far Right Button)
- Interactive Filters: Use the filter boxes above each column to narrow down data by year, genre, rating, director, and more no coding required.
- Smart Search Bar: The search field lets you look across all columns at once, making it easy to locate specific results fast.

Step 3d: Export Filtered Data (Far Right Button)
- Download Options: Easily export your filtered dataset.
- Format Choices: Choose between CSV, JSON, or Markdown for flexibility.
- One-Click Copy: Use the built-in copy tool to quickly grab and save your data for use in reports or other tools.

Step 4: Basic Summary Report

This step gives you a quick overview of your dataset:
- Rows & Columns: Shows how many rows and columns your file has.
- Data Types: Tells you what kind of data is in each column (like numbers or text).
- Missing Values: Shows if any data is missing in each column.
- Basic Stats: Gives simple stats (like average, min, and max) for number columns.
